A classic paper on the topic is [*How to Read a Paper*](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/HTRAP).
The author, [*Srinivasan Keshav*](https://svr-sk818-web.cl.cam.ac.uk/keshav/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
sets up a three pass reading systems that is reminiscent of the system proposed by [*Mortimer J. Adler*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortimer_J._Adler)
in the book [*How to Read a Book*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Publisher-Touchstone/dp/B004Q6U2MA/).
The more forceful variant of the book, [*How to Read a Book: The Art of Getting a Liberal Education*](https://archive.org/details/howtoreadbookart00adlerich/),
can be borrowed from the [*Internet Archive*](https://archive.org/).

The purpose of the first pass is roughly equivalent to the pidgeonhole and skimming technique proposed by Mr. Adler.
The detailed technique of the first pass is more tailored to the reading of a technical paper.
Since we know the paper in question is a technical paper, we can already make some reasonable assumptions of the paper:
its rough structure and its subject domain (assuming we are picking the paper ourselves).
As a result, we can be more precise when we narrow down precisely what kind of paper we are reading and we can identify the important sections to get an overview.

The purpose of the second pass is roughly equivalent to the "getting to terms with the author" phase of reading from *How to Read a Book*.

The purpose of the third pass is roughly equilvalent to the "criticize the author fairly" phase of the reading from *How to Read a Book*.

The prerequisite for able to perform a third pass is a good understanding of the field the paper is in.

The techniques for performing the first pass is the most detailed.

The techniques for performing the second pass starts to get more vague, but the outcome of the second phase is still precisely defined.

The techniques for performing the third pass feels opaque.

Become an “instant” expert. To dive into a subject, read 5-10 books on that topic. Then you can see the key ideas, the common threads, the mental models.
